3.3.12 Exercises - 5. Give Alternative Solution to Example 3.3.7

3.3.7 Example
Problem
    It is possible to have integers a, b, c, d and n
        with a ≡ b, c ≡ d, but a/c ≢ b/d

Solution
    a = 10, b = 18, c = 2, d = 6, n = 4
    (10 ≡ 18, 2 ≡ 6, but 5 ≢ 3)

One of Alternative Solution
    a = 16, b = 10, c = 4, d = 10, n = 6
    (16 ≡ 10, 4 ≡ 10, but 4 ≢ 1)
