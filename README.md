# The mechanics of proof

This repository contains the Lean code for the lecture notes [The mechanics of proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001), by [Heather Macbeth](https://faculty.fordham.edu/hmacbeth1), developed for the course Math 2001 at Fordham University.

The Lean files corresponding to each chapter of the lecture notes are in the folder [`Math2001`](https://github.com/hrmacbeth/math2001/tree/main/Math2001).  The folder [`Library`](https://github.com/hrmacbeth/math2001/tree/main/Library) contains supporting material, including automation custom-written for this course.

If you have a GitHub account, you can run the code on the web using Gitpod.  This is the easiest way to get started if you have never used Lean before.
